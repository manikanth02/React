What is difference between a javascripts variable, React useState and React useRef?

In terms of React ,javascripts variables is normal variables with no any super power(normal human beings)

while React useState is variable in React which have some super Powers like
1.When it changes it re-renders the components.
2.It references the value,even after doing re-rendering

while useRef is a hook that is used to reference the value that is not needed for rendering
